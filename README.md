Me trying to understand OpenGL with various videos and tutorials :)))

- Progress:
  - drawing triangle is working
  - drawing 3D triangle with perspective projection is working
  - using ImGui to change propertios of triangle so I dont have to stop the app change variable value and then start it again (tiring)
 
- 3rd party libs:
  - ImGui (docking) - using docking branch although it doesn't work rn for some reason (will look into it)
  - glew
  - glf3
  - glm
